        <h1>Moscow</h1>
        <p>
            In the Summer of 2021, I went to Moscow for 5 days, from July 24th to July 28th. It was my first time
            going anywhere on my own, and it was my first ever summer vacation not as a student, but as a worker.
            This page is a short summary and a photo album showing how it all went. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed the vacation.

            Since the train tickets were sold out by the time I was ready to book everything, I went by plane.
            I had a few music albums downloaded for offline listening, which is what I was doing during the flights there and back.

            Taking the Nintendo DS with me was a last-minute decision, but a very wise one. Since I traveled by metro
            a lot, I needed something to while riding, and the DS, acting as an e-book reader, was of great help. I read
            "The Old Man and the Sea" from the beginning to the end (what a story...) and started (re-)reading
            "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer".

            I booked a room at the same hotel my dad stayed in during his May trip. It's cheap, comfortable
            and is really close to a metro station. The view was nice as well; I used the window sill as a dining table.
            The room was on floor №27 out of 28.
            My only complaint is that the fridge would make loud weird noises
            for 5 minutes once every 15-20 minutes, making falling asleep a challenge.

            So, I arrived to the airport, boarded the Aeroexpress train from the airport to a train station in the city centre
            (a very convenient way to get from the airport to the city, although I messed up my timing a bit, so I had to wait
            an hour for the train), and then got to the hotel by metro. After buying some necessities, 
            such as a hairbrush, some teabags and a breakfast, in the nearest supermarket and offloading the luggage in the room
            (I only had a backpack with me), I took the metro to the city center. The first day mostly consisted of aimless wandering.

            These are the most well-known sights of the Red Square; the Spasskaya Tower and the Saint Basil's Cathedral.

            While on the Red Square, I also paid a visit to the GUM, which stands for Head Universal Store.
            The interior was beautifully decorated with numerous flowerbeds.

            After that, I headed towards the famous Arbat street. I didn't end up becoming a big fan of it though;
            it's just a pedestrian street with tons of stores and cafes and lots of street musicians (whom I don't really like).
            I had a dinner at one of the restaurants, and from the street I also saw one side of one of
            Stalin's "Seven Sisters", the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (more about the other side later).

            After the dinner, I went to take a closer look at the MFA building, and that's when I saw one of the best scenes
            I ever saw; the building was bathing in the rays of a clear day sunset, and it looked so gorgeous that
            no camera with any amount of editing won't be able to convey the wonderful colors I saw back then.

            For the second day, I have planned a walking route between the embassies of the countries I like; all of them are
            inside or close to the "Garden Ring" (a ring that surrounds the old city center; don't be fooled by the name, there are
            actually 0 gardens on it, but the traffic lanes are abundant), so it was a nice way to explore more of the center.
            <br>However, the first stop on my way was the Melnikov House; a house designed by a Russian architect Konstantin Melnikov
            and built in 1929 (way ahead of it's time). It was an experiment to see how a round shape of the house would work, and the architect actually lived there
            with his family. These days it's a museum but to get inside you have to book an excursion well in advance.

            The last embassy on my way should've been the Japanese embassy. I didn't end up taking any pictures of it as
            it was the only embassy that had guards outside of it, and the guard looked particularly gloomy and serious - I
            didn't want any potential trouble with him. I have to notice that, while the other embassies occupy small building
            or parts of buildings, the Japanese embassy occupies an entire large 5-story building; it's the largest
            embassy I saw, bar the US embassy.
            <br>On my way to the embassy I saw some nice buildings.

            After that, I wanted to take a trip to the Vorobyovy Gory metro station, which is unique as it's
            built on a bridge, but it turns out that the station was closed; luckily, the station's reopening
            was due next day, so I decided to go to "Moscow International Business Center", better known as Moscow-City; home
            of 7 of Europe's 10 tallest skyscrapers.
            <br>The subway is located underneath one of the buildings, and the exits, through a series of weird hallways and rooms,
            lead to a shopping mall. I suspect that it has a nice effect on the mall's income.
            <br>Looks liminal, doesn't it?

            As for the buildings themselves, I didn't like them. I love 2 kinds of skyscrapers; the old beautifully crafted
            skyscrapers (Moscow's Seven Sisters, USA's Art Deco skyscrapers) or the bland, simple and unassuming kind
            of skyscrapers that don't pretend to be some kinds of architectural masterpieces (lots of Japan's skyscrapers).
            Well, Moscow-City is neither. It all looks fake honestly, as if they just said "heyy let's build, like, some tall
            glass buildings to show everyone that we're, like, a capital, you know, rich and shit, like all the capitals do".
            I'm quite sure that it's exactly what the planners had in mind.

            Around that time the camera's battery charge indicator suddenly started flashing. I didn't bring the charger with
            me as it is rather bulky. The charge was still enough to last until the end of the trip, but I had to use it less
            from that point, so most of the photos from this point were taken with the phone camera.

            In Moscow, electric scooter sharing is extremely popular; there are <i>a lot</i> of scooter stations
            and <i>a lot</i> of people riding them. However, I didn't particularly liked it when I tried it back home,
            but I found that one of the sharing companies specializes on the usual kick scooters (non-electric), and
            they had a station near the opposite entrance to VDNKh. So, I decided to rent one to get back to the main entrance.
            It was rather nice!
            <br>
            The reason I went back to the main entrance is because I wanted to take a ride on the Monorail.
            The monorail was one of the ambitious projects of the former mayor; however, it wasn't really successful,
            so only one line has been built, and these days trains operate in a 30 minutes interval (there are only 2
            trains on the line). Talks of monorail's imminent closure have been going on for a while now, so I'm glad
            I got to ride it.
            <br>The cars are not connected, so the interior kind of looks like a ferrys wheel cabin.

            Having had a fine lunch at a sophisticated American cuisine restaurant (a McDonalds near the station),

            Having admired the station for long enough, I boarded a train and left at the next stop - the Moscow State University.
            The campus is rathe big, with lots of buildings, sports facilities and trees. The campus borders the Vorobyovy Gory
            park, so I had a great walk there.
            <br>The main building of the university is one of Stalin's Seven Sisters. Notice how apart from the usual clock
            it has a barometer.

            So I boarded the train in direction opposite to the university and left at the next station; my next
            stop was the Luzhniki stadium which is Moscow's most important and the most well-known stadium.

            After a refreshing walk in the park, I headed for a tram station (with the tram being the last remaining kind of
            rail transport I had to ride on in order to deem the trip successful) to get back to aimlessly wandering in the center.
            Interesting stuff seen along the way includes the Shabolovka radio tower, a semi-abandoned Skyline and a small
            cozy bunch of avant-garde houses that <a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@55.7132311,37.6109746,17.67z">look like this</a> from above.

            regret anything. Nothing particularly interesting happened, but is it really that bad?

            So, Moscow... Quite the city. A very comfortable one, with all this public transport development.
            A rather beautiful one too - if all Russian cities looked like Moscow inside the Garden ring, this country
            would've been much more pleasant to live in. With all these embassies, headquarters and other stuff everywhere, you get
            a feeling that you are indeed in a capital city and an important economic and cultural hub.
            <br>However, all this comes from the fact that Moscow sucks money from other Russian regions, which don't receive
            even a crumb of what Moscow receives. Maybe I'm just jealous, but this is not fair.
            <br>Also, it's too large to my liking. And there's something else that I can't put into words, but overall, even with
            all the good stuff, I still wouldn't want to live in Moscow. It doesn't mean it's a bad city - no, that's a damn awesome city,
            but it's just not for me. Still, I had a great time there. I felt true freedom. I felt proud for myself for organizing
            and paying for everything by myself. Even if nothing too exciting happened (indeed, it might look like I just went for a
            big walk - but for the kind of person I am, that's just great), I will still remember these days fondly.
